DESCRIPTION

The HKL package is a Matlab program that implements the hierarchical kernel learning method. For more information, please read the following papers:

F. Bach. Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel Learning. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2008. 
F. Bach. High-Dimensional Non-Linear Variable Selection through Hierarchical Kernel Learning. Technical report, HAL 00413473, 2009.

INSTALLATION

At the Matlab prompt, type "compile_hkl" and all mex files will be compiled. Detailed demo scripts are demo_regression.m and demo_classification.m

Memory requirements: note that the memory usage of the code is a parameter that needs to be set.
