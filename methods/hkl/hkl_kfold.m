% required parameter
% nfold                 5 or 10
% typefold              'same' or 'scaled' -> using same lambda or same lambda/n
% X                     input data: n x p matrix (n=number of observations)
%						or kernel matrices ( n(n+1)/2 x p x q single)
% Y                     responses ( n x 1 matrix )
%                       NB: for classification in {0,1} (and not in {-1,1})
% lambdas               regularization parameters (might be vector or single number)
%						better to start first with large values of lambdas
% loss                  loss function ('square','logistic')
